		Kenny McCormick
Age:9
Bio: Kenny McCormick is the poor member of the Four
Boys. Almost all of the time, Kenny wears a hood that muf-
fles his speech. Kenny being muffled is how he gets away
with
inappropriate and vulgar speech without having to be
bleeped out or censored. It is shown in latter seasons that
Kenny is Immortal and revives after every death, however
no one
besides him ever remembers his deaths.
Family:
•Mother: Carol McCormick
•Father: Stuart McCormick
•Brother: Kevin McCormick
•Sister: Karen McCormick
