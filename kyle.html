			Kyle Broflovski
Age: 9
Bio: Kyle Broflovski has always been considered one of the
most intelligent children in South Park, and whenever
crazy things are happening in South Park, Kyle and his
super best friend, Stan, are there to provide the voice of
reason and help resolve problems, often with a comforting
'gay little speech', something that has become Kyle's
trademark amongst his friends... for better or for worse. All
members of the Broflovski family are known for their
strong moral centers and standing up for what they believe
in... though not necessarily always to success. Nonetheless,
even when times seem their darkest, Kyle will never
back down from what he believes in.
Family:
•Mother: Sheila Broflovski
•Father: Gerald Broflovski
•Brother: Ike Broflovski
