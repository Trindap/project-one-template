		Stanly “Stan” Marsh
Age: 10
Bio: Stanley "Stan" Marsh has always been your comparatively
average all-American fourth grader... who happens
to live in one of the most fucked up places on Earth.
Whenever crazy things are happening in South Park, he
and Kyle are there to provide the voice of reason and help
resolve the problems, often with a comforting speech or at
least some memorable
highlights from Star Trek. He has a highly abusive sister
named Shelly, a gay dog named "Sparky", and is crazy in
love with his longtime girlfriend, Wendy Testaburger.
Family:
•Mother: Sharon Marsh
•Father: Randy Marsh
•Sister: Shelly Marsh
•Grandfather: Marvin Marsh
•Dog: Sparky
Quote: “Oh my god, they killed Kenny!”
